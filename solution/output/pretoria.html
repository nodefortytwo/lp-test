                  Introduction
                </h1>At once the ‘Afrikaner Jerusalem’, former headquarters of the apartheid state, and site of the presidential inauguration of Nelson Mandela, the pretty, laid-back city of Pretoria – the administrative capital – carries a remarkable amount of history for its age. Ironically, the city that for so long was a byword for white domination is now home to Thabo Mbeki, the liberated country’s black president.It’s just 50km from Jo’burg, and is expected within 15 years to form part of a megalopolis of 20 million people. Yet Pretoria moves at a slower pace than its giant neighbour and remains Afrikaans culturally. Military and educational institutions associated with the capital remain, while the tens of thousands of university students drive Pretoria’s vibrant nightlife.

                  Getting There
                </h1>Most interprovincial and international bus services commence in Pretoria, unless they are heading north. Translux, Greyhound and Intercape fares from Pretoria are identical to those from Jo’burg. If you only want to go between the two cities, it will cost about US$6. Minibus taxis leave from the main terminal by the train station and travel to a host of destinations including Jo’burg (US$4). Because of high incidents of crime, we don’t recommend taking the metro between Pretoria and Jo’burg. Baz Bus (Cape Town 021-439 2323; www.bazbus.com) will pick up and drop off at Pretoria hostels.Long-distance minibus taxis leave from near the railway and bus stations just off Scheidling St.

                  Getting Around
                </h1>Get You There (346 3175) operates shuttle buses between JIA and Pretoria, day and night about every hour, charging US$13 to/from hostels and hotels. If you call ahead, most hostels, and many hotels, offer free pick-up.There’s an extensive network of local buses. Fares range from US$0.70 to US$0.90, depending on the distance. There are taxi ranks on the corner of Church and Van der Walt Sts, and on the corner of Pretorius and Paul Kruger Sts.
