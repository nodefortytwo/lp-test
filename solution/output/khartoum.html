                  Introduction
                </h1>Built where the two Niles meet, Khartoum is one of the more modern cities in Central Africa, with paved roads, high-rise buildings and all the services you might want or need. Some travellers consider it nothing but a dusty, congested and joyless (nightlife is nearly nonexistent) stopover. But those looking to uncover its culture will appreciate what they find when they start walking around. Besides, its people are hospitable, the riverside setting is attractive and it’s one of the safest cities in Africa – so for one reason or another most people end up liking it here.
                <h1>
                  Getting Around
                </h1>Buses (SDD40 to SDD80) and minibuses (SDD100) cover most points in Khartoum and run very early to very late. Taxi prices (and if they have no passengers the minibuses work like taxis and often cost less) are negotiable: expect to pay around SDD400 to SDD500 for journeys within the city centre and SDD800 to destinations within greater Khartoum. For shorter trips (except in central Khartoum) there are also motorised rickshaws, which should cost no more than SDD300.The short ride by taxi from Khartoum airport to the city centre is unofficially fixed at SDD2500, though you can sometimes bargain this down. Better yet, try sharing the ride.
